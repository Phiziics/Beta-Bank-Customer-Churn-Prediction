# Project-8 DATE: May 8, 2024
Supervised Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will leave Beta Bank soon. Using data on clients' past behavior and contract terminations, the project seeks to identify patterns that indicate a customer's likelihood of churning.

The classification model will be optimized for the highest possible F1 score, aiming for a target of at least 0.59 on a test dataset. The F1 score balances precision and recall, making it an essential metric for evaluating performance with imbalanced data. The model will also be assessed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) metric.

By accurately predicting customer churn, Beta Bank can improve retention and loyalty, ultimately reducing costs associated with acquiring new customers and enhancing overall profitability.
